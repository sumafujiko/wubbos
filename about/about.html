<!--This part should be all about how the artist got started, how long shes been doing her thing for, it should also be about why she called them wubbos. She had fond memories of having cute characters on her belongings when she was younger, she grew up in a small village where she didn't have many friends so she created some. She wants the same for other people, especially children. Even as an adult they can still be appreciated. She offers them as designs for things like pillows, teddies, bed sheets, carpets, loads of different types of merchandise but also offers paintings where they can be seen interacting with each other. They're called wubbos because her first creation was named Wubbo.-->

                <h1>The 'Wubbos' Origin Story</h1>
                    <p>Wubbos is not just a collection of designs; it's a journey of creativity and heartfelt nostalgia. Born from the vivid imagination of our talented artist, Wubbos began as a childhood dream and has blossomed into a beloved brand cherished by many. Growing up in a quaint village where companionship was scarce, our artist found solace in crafting her own whimsical characters. From the tender age of seven, she poured her heart and soul into giving life to these endearing figures, each one brimming with personality and charm.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>For over two decades, our artist has been honing her craft, refining her skills, and weaving enchanting tales through her artwork. With a deep-rooted passion for bringing joy to others, she embarked on a mission to share her creations with the world. Drawing inspiration from her own experiences of finding comfort in imaginary friends, she named her creations "Wubbos" as a homage to her very first character, Wubbo. These delightful characters, with their playful antics and infectious smiles, have captured the hearts of many, transcending age and time.</p>
